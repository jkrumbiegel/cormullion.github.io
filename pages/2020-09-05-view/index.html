<p>MIT are running a <a href="https://mitmath.github.io/18S191/Fall20/">new introductory course on Computational Thinking</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We use the Julia programming language to approach real-world problems in varied areas applying data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling. In this class you will learn computer science, software, algorithms, applications, and mathematics as an integrated whole.1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teachers include Alan Edelman &#40;co-creator of Julia&#41;, well-known Julia educator David Sanders, Grant Sanderson, and James Schloss.</p>
<p>And Grant Sanderson turns out to be the voice behind the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown">3blue1brown</a> YouTube channel, with over three million subscribers. As you might imagine, I’m very keen on the visual approach he uses. I don’t always understand the maths, but the graphics are cool, and his relaxed and friendly tone makes learning as easy as it could be.</p>
<p>While browsing his <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">web site</a> I was intrigued by his logo, and the story behind it.</p>
<p>Out of interest, and as a sort of “Welcome to Julia&#33;”, I thought I’d have a go at interpreting his logo in Julia. It’s a great design. After sampling the colors, the code was straightforward.</p>

<p>The MIT course is using <a href="https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl">Pluto.jl</a> for exploring ideas. I like Pluto.jl a lot as well, because I share the developers’ belief that simplicity is worth striving for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe that scientific computing can be a lot simpler and more accessible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With Pluto.jl you can quickly explore the parameter space even of simple little logos like this. Here for example is a way to investigate different numbers of points for the stars:</p>
