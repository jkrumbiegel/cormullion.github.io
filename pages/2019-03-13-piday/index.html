<p>In the UK we have started to celebrate π day &#40;the 3rd month&#39;s 14th day&#41; every year, even though we don&#39;t use the USA&#39;s date formatting convention of <code>monthnumber</code> followed by <code>daynumber</code>. But we can&#39;t really celebrate the 31st of April &#40;31/4&#41; or the 3rd of Quatember &#40;?&#41; &#40;3/14&#41;, so we&#39;ll happily celebrate π day on 14/3 along with everyone else&#33;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I set myself a challenge at the beginning of March: make a π-related image using Julia and the Luxor.jl package every day until π day. Some days it worked out well, others didn&#39;t, but I&#39;ve gathered them all here anyway. This post has a fair few images, but not very much code or mathematical content.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="π_day"><a href="#π_day">π day</a></h1>
<p>The images here are in low-resolution: they should be available on my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/153311384@N03/">Flickr page</a> at their full resolution if you want to download or re-use them.</p>
<h3 id="day_1_circle_packing"><a href="#day_1_circle_packing">Day 1: Circle packing</a></h3>
<p>Circle packing may be a well-trodden path, but it always looks neat, and it&#39;s a nice easy start. You maintain a list of circles &#40;center point and radius&#41;. Then you create a random circle, check it against all the other ones, draw it if it doesn&#39;t overlap, or reduce the radius and try again. It&#39;s not very efficient but you can set it going and go and make some coffee.</p>
<p>To make the π shape appear, the code creates a path:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">fontsize&#40;480&#41;
textoutlines&#40;&quot;π&quot;, O, :path, halign&#61;:center, valign&#61;:middle&#41;
πoutline &#61; first&#40;pathtopoly&#40;&#41;&#41;</code></pre>
<p>then checks whether each circle&#39;s centerpoint is inside or outside the outline of the π shape:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">isinside&#40;pt, πoutline&#41;</code></pre>
<p>and colors it accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="day_2_dry_and_wet"><a href="#day_2_dry_and_wet">Day 2: Dry and wet</a></h3>
<p>I repeated myself today, thinking I could develop the circles a bit more, and ended up with this glossier wet-look version. The apparently random-looking shapes in the background are Bézier splodges that are supposed to be splashes...</p>

<h3 id="day_3_π_packing"><a href="#day_3_π_packing">Day 3: π packing</a></h3>
<p>This is π packing rather than circle packing, although the code is again quite similar in outline: choose a point at random, find the largest font size at which the π character fits without overlapping others in the list, and then place it and add it to the list. The colors are a bit murky though.</p>

<h3 id="day_4_rainbow"><a href="#day_4_rainbow">Day 4: Rainbow</a></h3>
<p>Combining concentric circles and rainbow colors, this image shows about 350 digits of π.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/piday/digits-of-pi-avenir-800.png" alt="image label" /></p>
<p>To generate the digits of π, I use this function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">function pidigits&#40;n&#41;
    result &#61; BigInt&#91;&#93;
    k, a, b, a1, b1 &#61; big.&#40;&#91;2, 4, 1, 12, 4&#93;&#41;
    while n &gt; 0
        p, q, k &#61; k^2, 2k &#43; 1, k &#43; 1
        a, b, a1, b1 &#61; a1, b1, p * a  &#43;  q * a1, p * b  &#43;  q * b1
        d, d1 &#61; a ÷ b, a1 ÷ b1
        while d &#61;&#61; d1
            push&#33;&#40;result, d&#41;
            n -&#61; 1
            a, a1 &#61; 10&#40;a &#37; b&#41;, 10&#40;a1 &#37; b1&#41;
            d, d1 &#61; a ÷ b, a1 ÷ b1
        end
    end
    return result
end</code></pre>
<p>It looks like witchcraft to me, but I understand that it&#39;s a &quot;spigot&quot; algorithm. I was hoping for a while that it was named after a Professor Spigot, but in fact it&#39;s describing the way the digits trickle out one by one like drops of water. It&#39;s quick enough for a thousand digits or so, but slows down a lot when you ask for 100_000 or more, probably due to the hard work that the big integer library has to do: even when you&#39;re just calculating the first 15 digits of π, the values of <code>a1</code> and <code>b1</code> are way over the limits of Int64s.</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">julia-1.1&gt; @time pidigits&#40;1000&#41;;
 0.014522 seconds &#40;44.90 k allocations: 9.425 MiB, 28.97&#37; gc time&#41;</code></pre>
<p>The image might work better on white:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/piday/digits-of-pi-avenir-on-white-800.png" alt="image label" /></p>
<p>Sometimes I wanted to check where certain sequences of digits appeared. I couldn&#39;t find a built-in function that looked for a sequence of digits in an array, but this worked well enough for my purposes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">function findsubsequence&#40;needle, haystack&#41;
    result &#61; Int64&#91;&#93;
    for k in 1:length&#40;haystack&#41; - length&#40;needle&#41;
        if needle &#61;&#61; view&#40;haystack, k:k &#43; length&#40;needle&#41; - 1&#41;
            push&#33;&#40;result, k&#41;
        end
    end
    return result
end

findsubsequence&#40;str::String, digits&#41; &#61;
    findsubsequence&#40;map&#40;x -&gt; parse&#40;Int, x&#41;, split&#40;str, &quot;&quot;&#41;&#41;, digits&#41;

findsubsequence&#40;&quot;999999&quot;, pidigits&#40;2000&#41;&#41; # &#61;&gt; &#91;763&#93;</code></pre>

<p>A chunky typeface like the Avenir Heavy I used yesterday is good for masking and clipping. But I wondered how the narrowest typeface would look. I found Briem Akademi, designed by Gunnlaugur Briem at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. Adobe&#39;s description says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most compressed version works best where legibility is less important than dramatic visual effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I like the abstract look even though it&#39;s almost illegible... Would this make nice bathroom tiles?</p>

<h3 id="day_6_breakfast_and_tiffany"><a href="#day_6_breakfast_and_tiffany">Day 6 Breakfast and Tiffany</a></h3>
<p>I&#39;m still thinking about using typefaces. I&#39;m a fan of Ed Benguiat&#39;s ITC Tiffany font, his nostalgic look back from the 1970s to the age of Edwardian elegance.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/piday/pi-digits-appearing-800.png" alt="image label" /></p>
<p>It&#39;s easy to do this with tables. Like the circle packing, the code checks whether the coordinates of each table cell fall within a given perimeter, and changes the font accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="day_7_distinguished"><a href="#day_7_distinguished">Day 7 Distinguished</a></h3>
<p>The excellent Colors.jl package has a function called <code>distinguishable_colors&#40;&#41;</code> &#40;which fortunately tab-completes&#41;. The help text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This uses a greedy brute-force approach to choose <code>n</code> colors that are maximally distinguishable. Given <code>seed</code> color&#40;s&#41;, and a set of possible hue, chroma, and lightness values &#40;in LCHab space&#41;, it repeatedly chooses the next color as the one that maximizes the minimum pairwise distance to any of the colors already in the palette.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much to do with color depends on the viewer&#39;s perception, but I think it works well here. It starts at the top left, and works from left to right. &#40;That pesky decimal point defaults to using the previous color...&#41; You can spot the Feynman point &#40;<code>999999</code>&#41; halfway down on the left &#40;look for the six consecutive sandy brown squares&#41;, or the four purple sevens on the bottom row.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/piday/pi-distinguishable_colors-800.png" alt="image label" /></p>
<p>I remembered to try to choose the color for the small labels &#40;probably unreadable in the low-resolution PNG you see here&#41; so that they&#39;re either light on dark, or dark on light.</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">... r, g, b &#61; color of square
gamma &#61; 2.2
luminance &#61; 0.2126 * r^gamma &#43; 0.7152 * g^gamma &#43; 0.0722 * b^gamma
&#40;luminance &gt; 0.5^gamma&#41; ? sethue&#40;&quot;black&quot;&#41; : sethue&#40;&quot;white&quot;&#41;</code></pre>

<p><img src="/assets/images/piday/candy-crush.png" alt="image label" /></p>
<p>I must have seen an advert for CandyCrush yesterday, or perhaps all that talk of gamma and LCHab spaces caused a reaction, but this sugar rush of an image was the result. The SVG version looks tasty but is too big for this web page.</p>

<p>Arranging the sweets in a spiral looks tidy.</p>

<h3 id="day_10_π_into_circumference"><a href="#day_10_π_into_circumference">Day 10 π into circumference</a></h3>
<p>Luxor&#39;s <code>polysample&#40;&#41;</code> function takes a polygon and samples it at regular intervals. This allows the following idea, where each point on a shape &#40;here, the outline of the π character&#41; is slowly moved to a matching location on the circular shape around the outside.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/piday/pi-to-circle-800.png" alt="image label" /></p>
<p>For a point on the π border <code>p1</code>, and a matching point on the circumference polygon <code>p2</code>, the intermediate point is given by <code>between&#40;p1, p2, n&#41;</code>, where <code>n</code> is between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>I like the almost 3D effect you get from this.</p>
<h3 id="day_11_charcoal"><a href="#day_11_charcoal">Day 11 Charcoal</a></h3>
<p>Time for a charcoal sketch:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/piday/pi-charcoal-1-800.png" alt="image label" /></p>
<p>The crinkly edges of the paper are made by the <code>polysample&#40;&#41;</code> function on a rectangle then applying simplex-<code>noise&#40;&#41;</code>-y nudges to the vertices. The paper is textured with <code>rule&#40;&#41;</code>d lines, and there&#39;s some very low values for <code>setopacity&#40;&#41;</code> smudges. Shifting the Bézier curve handles slightly for each iteration gives a brushy/sketchy feel. &#40;It&#39;s fortunate I can copy and paste some of this code from drawings I&#39;ve made before: I&#39;ve learnt the hard way that it&#39;s better keep things than throw them away...&#41;</p>
<h3 id="day_12"><a href="#day_12">Day 12</a></h3>
<p>I ran out of time on this one, and there are still some problems with the text spacing. The idea is to have the infinite digits of π spiral into some fiery star with some space-y stuff. Probably not the sort of image I should be attempting at all with simple vector-based 2D graphics tools, but it feels like a challenge. Those wispy trails are the same as yesterday&#39;s brush strokes, but using custom <code>setdash&#40;&#41;</code> dashing patterns.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/piday/pi-cosmic-spiral-800.png" alt="image label" /></p>
<h3 id="day_13"><a href="#day_13">Day 13</a></h3>
<p>The idea here is to show which digit of π is the current leader, in terms of how many times that digit has appeared already. &#40;Yes, a stupid idea, I know&#33;&#41; Then I couldn&#39;t decide on how many digits to show, so it&#39;s going to be an animated GIF showing the first 1000 digits. At the 200 digit mark poor old &quot;7&quot; is struggling at the back of the field, but the glory days are ahead - after 1000 digits, it&#39;s overtaken 0, 4, and 6.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/piday/200-digits-of-pi-800.png" alt="image label" /></p>
<p>The animation turned into a video rather than a GIF, because I don&#39;t like the low resolution of GIFs today.</p>
<p>And now of course I have to add a suitable audio soundtrack. Luckily I&#39;ve recently been playing with George Datseris&#39; <a href="https://github.com/JuliaMusic">MIDI interface for Julia</a>, so it was easy enough to make a musical version of the first 1000 digits of π, where the digits from 0 to 9 choose the appropriate note from a reasonably harmonious scale.</p>

<p>This &quot;sonification&quot; &#40;or &quot;audification&quot;&#41; is just for fun. For a more convincing critique of these sonifications than I can provide, watch the always entertaining <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;Ocq3NeudsVk">Tantacrul</a>&#39;s presentation on YouTube.</p>
<p>And while you&#39;re on YouTube, the π video is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfd52kTA5JpzOEItSqXLQxg">my YouTube channel</a>, and it&#39;s my entry for YouTube&#39;s Most Boring Video of 2019 competition, but I suspect it won&#39;t do very well—competition in this category is fierce, even if sometimes the contestants are unwilling participants.</p>
<p>Happy π day&#33;</p>
